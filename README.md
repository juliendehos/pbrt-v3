This repository holds the source code to the new version of pbrt that will
be described in the forthcoming third edition of *Physically Based
Rendering: From Theory to Implementation*, by [Matt
Pharr](http://pharr.org/matt), [Wenzel
Jakob](http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/~wenzel/), and Greg Humphreys.  As
before, the code is available under the BSD license.

Please see the [User's
Guide](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/blob/master/docs/UsersGuide.md) for
more information about how to check out and build the system as well as
various additional information about working with pbrt.

Over 4GB of example scenes are available for download. (Many are new and
weren't available with previous versions of pbrt.) We're trying an
experiment and making them available via git. Run:
```
$ git clone git://git.pbrt.org/pbrt-v3-scenes
```
to get them. We will update this repository as more scenes become
available. (See the `README.md.html file` in the scene distribution for
more information about the scenes and preview images.)

The [pbrt website](http://pbrt.org) has  general information about
both *Physically Based Rendering* as well as pbrt-v2, the previous version
of the system.
