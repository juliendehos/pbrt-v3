Description:
I designed a room for the chair I modelled recently. This is my favourite sce ne to date. Have to say I used to use MAX in the late 90's and I could never get as good a result as this. Blender is awesome, I love it.

I've took the image on the canvas out of the .blend file. I downloaded it of google images and wasn't sure about the licence. It's not to hard to just put your own image on i t though, it's UV mapped so should be easy.

Hope you like it.

Ch eers, Wayne
